Hi there,

We were chatting and one of my friend mentioned about his tiffin service business
and how he is struggling to keep track of orders as business grows.
This is the soution i have proposed. 

run main.py and you will be faced with application.
MenuToday.xlsx has details of daily menu
customer_database.xlsx has customer details for future communications
order_histiry has details of daily orders

highlights of the application: 
Menu items can be decided as per need with pricing
You get separate backup to keep your important customers
Order history lets you analyse daily volume of orders.
